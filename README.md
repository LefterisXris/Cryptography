# Cryptography

This project is developed during the course of "Cryptography" in University of Macedonia.

I developed some python scripts, using [Sage math cloud version](https://cloud.sagemath.com/).

There are two files. One for each Task that I had to complete.

In the Task 1 I had to work with classic Cryptosystems.

In the Task 2 I had to face more recent Cryptosystems.
